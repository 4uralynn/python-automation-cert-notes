Managing Time
=============

We want to spend our time ***meaningfully*** and make sure we are optimizing how
we use it. One effective way to do this is the **Eisenhower Decision Matrix**:

|         +         |       Urgent      |     Not Urgent   |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
|   **Important**   |     ASAP (1)      |  Long-term (2)   |
| **Not Important** | Interruptions (3) | Distractions (4) |


  1. In general, we want to make sure we **spend the majority** of our time on tasks that are **important**, beginning with **urgent tasks**. 

  2. But we do need to **block some time for long-term** planning and execution. This inlucdes time for researching new tech and resolving **technical debt**.

**Technical debt** is pending work that accumulates when we choose quick-and-easy
solutions instead of applying a sustainable long-term one. 

  + The difference between *short-term remediation* and completing *long-term remediation*
  + We need to **schedule time to apply long-term solutions**.

  3. In IT, time needs to be set aside for **inturruptions**, such as communications, emails, management/owners, etc. **The key is to reserve a window of time for yourself when you will NOT be interrupted**.

Changing locations or silencing notifications may be the appropriate so that you
are able to have time to focus on important tasks.

## Prioritizing

Basic structure that can help to *prioritize* our tasks. Find a system that works
*best for you*. 

  1. **Make a list** of all tasks needing to get done. This could be anything from a plain piece of paper, or a ticket management system.
  2. **Check the real urgency** of each task *(if not done today, will something bad happen?)*. Complete the most urgent taks immediately.
  3. **Asses the importance of each** issue. *Tasks that other taks depend on* or *issues that affect more people* are more important.
  4. **Understand how much effort** tasks will take *(small, medium, large)*. Save *the most complex tasks* for times we are *least likely to be interrupted*.
 
## Estimating the Time Tasks Will Take

A lot of the time we make estimations based on ideal situations. Make estimations
**by comparing the current task to similar tasks done in the past**.

Remember to factor in extra time for the **integration of several tasks**, after
adding the estimates for each task together. *Integration time should also be*
*based on past experience*. 

Even after all this, the number will still be fairly close to an ideal time, and
does not account for unknowns. Buffer the estimate. **Multiply the estimate by**
**a factor** based on previous experience. 

___

**EXAMPLE:**
If the last time you completed this task, it took you *3 times* longer than 
expected, it would be appropiate to multiply by a factor of 3.

___


Once making your estimation, keep track of it to refer back later, or when you need
to make another similar estimation.
